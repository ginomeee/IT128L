# IT128L - SIA 2  
***
For the IT128L class Systems Integration and Architecture 2 under ma'am Antonette Gabriel


## Prerequisites
* Install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers: [Which can be downloaded here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2022-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers)
* Install Java SE Development Kit 8: Version 8 in their website iHels equivalent to 1.8 which is what we need. [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html)
* Set the PATH file for `JRE_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` to the appropriate directory. Here's a [helpful guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)

## Setup
1. Set the working directory on every exercise (e.g. EX1 working directory should be pointed to the folder EX1)
2. Make sure the appropriate library and version number is selected in the Eclipse. (Right click the project>Library>Java). Point it to the install folder of your Java install.
3. (Optional) Make sure to have any requisite jar file that may possibly be needed.
4. Run the exercise / activity.

***
## Notes
* Each exercise has a different workspace directory but they should all have more or less the same settings. Remember to set the Java library directory and version number on Eclipse to the appropriate one on your machine.
