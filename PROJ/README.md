This is basically a car inventory system where users can:
- Create and upload data of a new car
- View / Read data of vehicles in the inventory
- Update records of existing vehicles
- Delete records of existing vehicles

This is a Java program that uses a MySQL database and connects via the localhost server.

*Note:* PROJP2 *requires* `mysql-connector-java-8.0.30.jar` located in the root directory of this repository. Fix the build settings and point the missing JAR file to the file.
